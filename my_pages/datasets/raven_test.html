        <p>Raven matrices tests have widespread practical use-as a measure of intelligence in the general population for both adults and children, for job applicants as a psychometric test, for applicants to the armed forces, and for assessing clinical (e.g. Autism) populations. In this study the Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM) with 48 problems were applied to two populations: 21 students of Design and Multimedia and 24 of students Engineering Informatics. EEG signals are registered while the participants perform the tasks of the test. The 48 problems that form the test are divided into two phases: the first 12 where the participant receive a feedback about his answer and the last 36 where no feedback is given. The score of the test is the number of correct answers of the second part. The figure 3 illustrates the time evolution and the relevant marks for each The signals were registered using Enobio 8 EEG recording headset and 8 channels: F3, F4, T7, C3, Cz, C4, T8 and Pz. And the relevant marks for the signal analysis are around</p>

        <h3>Feature extraction</h3>

        <p>Two data sets are organized</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The pre-processing step comprises average signals of all trials of one participant considering the training and the testing phase. The data set is available for each participant.</li>
            <li>For each participant each trial is processed and the features as described later are computed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Time Features</h4>

        <p>The chosen event-related potentials were P100 and P300. These were chosen because of attentional characteristics that have sometimes been attributed to the P100 potential, as well as the attentional and relationship that is known to exist between the P300 potential and cognitive activity.</p>

        <p>The P100 and P300 re defined in the first two intervals (display and solution) and its latency and amplitude is stored. Only relevant channels were considered (see the data files).</p>

        <h4>Frequency Features</h4>

        <p>The energy of the characteristic bands are estimated in all defined windows. The energy (E) in the characteristic bands are used to compute other higher level features defined as energy ratios.</p>
